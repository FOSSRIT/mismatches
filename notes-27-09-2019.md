_These notes are from a discussion between Steve Jacobs and Mel Chua on 27 Sep 2019, in Atlanta GA. They are rough, raw braindumps; they may not be readable by others yet, and that's okay. All part of trying to do this work in the open as much as possible._

Information is available, not necessarily seen
Participation, usage, and roles (both upstream and downstream) are often self-initiated and not clearly recorded

What's sustainability:
- financial / operating costs
  - servers, etc.
  - people time
- bus factor; are there enough contributors, can people step away?
  - burnout vs guilt
- is there interest in it existing? (incl. but not limited to users)
- visibility
- people being involved, new people coming in, diverse types of people

What's well-maintained
- keeping up with responses to incoming issues in a timely manner
- processes/styles/etc. up-to-date with modern standards ("what a modern contributor would expect")
- test coverage
- documentation
- issue tracker
- automated testing
- specifications for what it should do
- ability for people with basic skills to contribute

Dynamics:
- "nobody stopped me"

Employer time:
- tension re: corporate control
- pays for time spent, but "would do anyway, just slower and at cost to family"
- FOSS people often filter potential employers by whether they'll allow and not constrain FOSS work
- project management is the hard part to find!

Upstream:
- predates web frameworks
- backstory: previous python.org project failure taught PSF the need for project management
- "in flight, but never really got over the finish line"
- got server space donated; would be HUGELY expensive if not
- side project that became production
- "mudball architecture"
- this is terrible, let's start from scratch
- don't know what people are using how; what can we break, what shouldn't we?
- communications: you can try everything, but some people will still ignore it
- big win: people can contribute now, fed into the energy ("stickers")
- maybe we should turn it off, that's how we get people to pay attention

Downstream:
- "there's info out there, I just never kept up, it's too much"
- heard through twitter, friends, etc. "but I guess there's the blog and mailing list also"
- people-to-people connections important
- assumed it was magic
- "how did i not see that mess?"
- don't need to know, don't want to know; it's plumbing
- always worked, never thought about it (didn't evaluate it the way we would evaluate a library)
- "i feel weird that my company never knew python needed help"
- tension between "oh yeah, of course!" and "it's still magic"
- "Donald, the hero of PyPI - wait, needs a job?"
-  we could have done the technical transition any time, it's the communication and financial part that was hard
- "breaking stuff on users" - infra upgrades are not like library upgrades because you have to decide when to switch the service over, whereas users decide when to transition between libraries

FOSS culture:
- itch-scraching
- "it's fun!"
- project management: less fun
- we don't make people sign up, track, etc. - pros and cons

PSF:
- needed a way to handle money
- needed to learn to hire project managers
- needed a track record for applying for grants (wants a more open process later)
- could run PyPI as a business, has decided not to
- limited by international laws
- management of donations, volunteer relationships, etc. takes up paid staff time
