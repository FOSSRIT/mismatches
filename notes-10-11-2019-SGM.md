software attempts to encapsulate information and make it so people don't have to think about x or y or z.  software that people have expectations about become infrastructure.  so software infrastructure is encapsulated information or services that people don't have to think about.

it is the combination of EXPECTATION and ENCAPSULATION that are in tension because when expectations are violated people are encapsulated from learning about and fixing the problem.  it's not a problem that expectations are violated necessarily but that they happen in a way where there's not support for fixing the violation.

FOSS is especially prone to problems because:

- no contracts, even usually informal ones, that explicate what to do when expectations are violated; no particularly clear expectations in the first place

- more generally, FOSS is not a diverse group and a more diverse group will have more diverse expectations, uncovering "mismatched" expectations earlier on in the process

- without contracts or clear expectations, one of the first manifestations of violated expectations is negative emotions which FOSS is especially culturally predisposed to have a hard time to handle

- additionally, FOSS selects for people who take infrastructure for granted, we're used to having our expectations met and are therefore not great at thinking intentionally about how to address violations of expectations.  and this taking of infrastructure for granted can make it harder to attract people who do know/care about infrastructure.
