# Explanation

This is an exercise we did during our analysis retreat based on the game "Snake Oil" (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/113289/snake-oil) where players have to make up products based on cards they have in their hands. Similarly, we tried to come up with (preliminary) answers to our research questions based on the materials and insights we had generated during the retreat.

_On implicit and explicit contracts/expectations:_

* If there is a specific person or organization who has earned #trust and whose support of the infrastructure is considered #magic, they need to speak up about #burnout or other problems before other people/organizations will step up to help. Help is pull, not push.
* It is natural and #evolution for people to #burnout, for #authority to fall via #doocracy to certain #contribtypes, for #speedexpectations to be variable in the absence of #contracts, and for users to only be able to expect the kinds of work and progress that #selfdirected #motivation from certain #contribtypes (per usual #whatisfoss fossroles) will drive.
* We have #emotions around what we expect, and we want to protect ourselves from others' #emotions, serving our duty but not being overwhelmed with their perceptions of their needs/desires, to prevent #burnout.

_On conceptions of well-maintained and sustainable FOSS digital infrastructure:_

* The #speedexpectations are met, not just when/if the user assessing sustainability/maintainedness needs something, but in the recent past, when the user uses #transparency and #tooling such as GitHub to check on recent commits and bug replies.
* There exist #contracts -- explicit financial ones to ensure labor for upkeep -- or the implicit contract of #magic in that it works reliably and thus creates expectations of reliability.
* Even without #personalconnections, the infrastructure does what you need it to do.
* #Corpdirection is not a driver of the product direction.

_On how PyPI illustrates those:_

* The #financialinfrastructure of the PSF and the #contracts started with the Mozilla award influenced people's perception of the maintainability and sustainability of PyPI.
* While #selfdirected #doocracy #motivation #whatisfoss labor led to the creation and initial work on Warehouse, and while sponsors gave PyPI in-kind donations, the donation of money via the MOSS award #contracts #financialinfrastructure is what made the phase change possible to increase PyPI's #busfactor.
* Our #personalconnections to Donald, et alia affect, even determine, the #linesofcommunication that cause us to understand whether PyPI's #busfactor is adequate. (Tension: deep focus versus broad awareness.)
