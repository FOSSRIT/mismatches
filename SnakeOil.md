# Explanation

This is an exercise we did during our analysis retreat based on the game "Snake Oil" (https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/113289/snake-oil) where players have to make up products based on cards they have in their hands. Similarly, we tried to come up with (preliminary) answers to our research questions based on the materials and insights we had generated during the retreat.
